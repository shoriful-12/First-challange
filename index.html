Types of Web Developers
Front-End Developer
These web developers focus on the user-facing sides of websites. They create intuitive user interfaces with a keen eye for compelling design.
Back-End Developer
Back-end developers specialize in websites' nuts and bolts, optimizing the crucial hidden elements most users never see. They often design databases and use languages like PHP, CSS, or Python.
Full-Stack Developer
Full-stack web developers combine front-end and back-end development. They consider the creation process from both angles and possess the skills to complete tasks on either end of the spectrum
What Do Web Developers Do?
Web developers typically work with web-based application servers, desktop or notebook computers, and other programming devices. They use those tools to develop the coding processes for functional and visually compelling websites. When writing code, web developers use languages like HTML, Python, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and CSS.

Web development also includes site maintenance and upkeep. In addition to design, qualified professionals evaluate code for accuracy, redundancies, and structural integrity. They increase site performance by enhancing server-side components and optimizing site elements for scalability or outside integration.

Web developers often work alongside other professionals in web design and software development. These fields share some similarities, but the following information details some key differences to keep in mind.

Web Developer
These specialists focus on the codes that allow websites to run smoothly. They possess advanced programming skills, including competency in machine learning technology, systems analysis, and database management. They often work with web designers to ensure proper functionality.

They also value collaborative work, with over 70% of web developers rating work with others in a group or team as very or extremely important.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) ranks computer systems design, software publishing and management, and scientific or technical consulting services among the top industries for web developers.

Web Developer Skills
Skilled web developers need proficiency in common coding and programming languages ‚Äî such as Python, C++, and JavaScript ‚Äî before entering the workforce. Coding bootcamps can help, but only if students select the best bootcamp suited to their career goals. Some bootcamps may focus on areas other than web development, for example.
