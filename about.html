          <p>A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, <br>within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example,<br> law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors.<br><br>This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare.</p>
